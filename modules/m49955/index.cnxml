    <para id="import-auto-id1167804269506"><emphasis effect="bold"> </emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">Superconductors</emphasis>, materials that have no resistance to the flow of electricity, are one of the last great frontiers of scientific discovery. Not only have the limits of superconductivity not yet been reached, but the theories that explain superconductor behavior seem to be constantly under review. In 1911 superconductivity was first observed in mercury by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes of <link url="http://www.leiden.edu/">Leiden University</link>. When he cooled it to the temperature of liquid helium, 4 degrees Kelvin (-452F, -269C), its <link url="http://superconductors.org/history.htm#resist">resistance</link> suddenly disappeared. The Kelvin scale represents an "absolute" scale of temperature. Thus, it was necessary for Onnes to come within 4 degrees of the coldest temperature that is theoretically attainable to witness the phenomenon of superconductivity. Later, in 1913, he won a Nobel Prize in physics for his research in this area.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167807888710">The next great milestone in understanding how matter behaves at extreme cold temperatures occurred in 1933. German researchers Walther Meissner (above left) and Robert Ochsenfeld (above right) discovered that a superconducting material will repel a magnetic field (below graphic). A magnet moving by a conductor induces currents in the conductor. This is the principle on which the electric generator operates. But, in a superconductor the induced currents exactly mirror the field that would have otherwise penetrated the superconducting material - causing the magnet to be repulsed. This phenomenon is known as strong diamagnetism and is today often referred to as the "Meissner effect" (an eponym). The Meissner effect is so strong that a magnet can actually be <link url="http://superconductors.org/history.htm#meiss">levitated</link> over a superconductive material.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804270415"> In subsequent decades other superconducting metals, alloys and compounds were discovered. In 1941 niobium-nitride was found to superconduct at 16 K. In 1953 vanadium-silicon displayed superconductive properties at 17.5 K. And, in 1962 scientists at Westinghouse developed the first commercial superconducting wire, an alloy of niobium and titanium (NbTi). High-energy, particle-accelerator electromagnets made of copper-clad niobium-titanium were then developed in the 1960s at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory in the UK, and were first employed in a superconducting accelerator at the <link url="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab Tevatron</link> in the US in 1987.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167803246258"><emphasis effect="bold"> </emphasis> The first widely-accepted theoretical understanding of superconductivity was advanced in 1957 by American physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer (above). Their <emphasis effect="italics">Theories of</emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">Superconductivity</emphasis> became known as the <link url="http://superconductors.org/terms.htm#BCS">BCS theory</link> - derived from the first letter of each man's last name - and won them a <link url="http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1972/">Nobel prize in 1972</link>. The mathematically-complex BCS theory explained superconductivity at temperatures close to absolute zero for <link url="http://superconductors.org/type1.htm">elements</link> and <link url="http://superconductors.org/type2.htm#alloys">simple alloys</link>. However, at higher temperatures and with different superconductor systems, the BCS theory has subsequently become inadequate to fully explain how superconductivity is occurring.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167803368928"> Another significant theoretical advancement came in 1962 when Brian D. Josephson, a graduate student at <link url="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</link>, predicted that electrical current would flow between 2 superconducting materials - even when they are separated by a non-superconductor or insulator. His prediction was later confirmed and won him a share of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics. This tunneling phenomenon is today known as the <link url="http://superconductors.org/terms.htm#josephsn">"Josephson effect"</link> and has been applied to electronic devices such as the <link url="http://superconductors.org/history.htm#squid">SQUID</link>, an instrument capabable of detecting even the weakest magnetic fields. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167803409867"> The 1980's were a decade of unrivaled discovery in the field of superconductivity. In 1964 Bill Little of Stanford University had suggested the possibility of organic (carbon-based) superconductors. The first of these theoretical superconductors was successfully synthesized in 1980 by Danish researcher <link url="http://superconductors.org/history.htm#klaus_b">Klaus Bechgaard</link> of the University of Copenhagen and 3 French team members. (TMTSF)<sub>2</sub>PF<sub>6</sub> had to be cooled to an incredibly cold 1.2K transition temperature (known as Tc) and subjected to <link url="http://superconductors.org/terms.htm#pressure">high pressure</link> to superconduct. But, its mere existence proved the possibility of "designer" molecules - molecules fashioned to perform in a predictable way.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804326135">Then, in 1986, a truly breakthrough discovery was made in the field of superconductivity. Alex Müller and Georg Bednorz , researchers at the IBM Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon, Switzerland, created a brittle ceramic compound that superconducted at the highest temperature then known: 30 K. What made this discovery so remarkable was that ceramics are normally insulators. They don't conduct electricity well at all. So, researchers had not considered them as possible high-temperature superconductor candidates. The Lanthanum, Barium, Copper and Oxygen compound that Müller and Bednorz synthesized, behaved in a not-as-yet-understood way. <link url="http://superconductors.org/condmatt.htm">(Original article printed in Zeitschrift für Physik Condensed Matter, April 1986.)</link> The discovery of this first of the superconducting copper-oxides (cuprates) won the 2 men a Nobel Prize the following year. It was later found that tiny amounts of this material were actually superconducting at 58 K, due to a small amount of lead having been added as a calibration standard - making the discovery even more noteworthy.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167803353124">     Müller and Bednorz' discovery triggered a flurry of activity in the field of superconductivity. Researchers around the world began "cooking" up ceramics of every imaginable combination in a quest for higher and higher Tc's. In January of 1987 a research team at the University of Alabama-Huntsville substituted Yttrium for Lanthanum in the Müller and Bednorz molecule and achieved an incredible 92 K Tc. For the first time a material (today referred to as YBCO) had been found that would superconduct at temperatures warmer than liquid nitrogen - a commonly available coolant. Additional milestones have since been achieved using exotic - and often toxic - elements in the base <link url="http://superconductors.org/terms.htm#pero">perovskite</link> ceramic. The current class (or "system") of ceramic superconductors with the highest transition temperatures are the mercuric-cuprates. The first synthesis of one of these compounds was achieved in 1993 at the University of Colorado and by the team of A. Schilling, M. Cantoni, J. D. Guo, and H. R. Ott of Zurich, Switzerland. The world record Tc of 138 K is now held by a thallium-doped, mercuric-cuprate comprised of the elements Mercury, Thallium, Barium, Calcium, Copper and Oxygen. The Tc of <link url="http://superconductors.org/type2.htm#record">this ceramic superconductor</link> was confirmed by Dr. Ron Goldfarb at the National Institute of Standards and Technology-Colorado in February of 1994. Under extreme pressure its Tc can be coaxed up even higher - approximately 25 to 30 degrees more at 300,000 atmospheres.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804288298"><emphasis effect="bold">   </emphasis>The first company to capitalize on high-temperature superconductors was Illinois Superconductor (today known as <link url="http://www.iscointl.com/">ISCO International</link>), formed in 1989. This amalgam of government, private-industry and academic interests introduced a depth sensor for medical equipment that was able to operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~ 77K). </para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804312273">   In recent years, many discoveries regarding the novel nature of superconductivity have been made. In 1997 researchers found that at a temperature very near absolute zero an alloy of gold and indium was both a superconductor and a natural magnet. Conventional wisdom held that a material with such properties <emphasis effect="italics">could not exist!</emphasis>  Since then, over a <link url="http://superconductors.org/type2.htm#shortlst">half-dozen such compounds</link> have been found. Recent years have also seen the discovery of the first high-temperature superconductor that <link url="http://superconductors.org/91k.htm">does NOT contain any copper</link> (2000), and the first <link url="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epccm/past/Nugget%202001-IRG1-Superconductivity.htm">all-metal perovskite superconductor</link> (2001).</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804216734">     Also in 2001 a material that had been sitting on laboratory shelves for decades was found to be an extraordinary new superconductor. Japanese researchers measured the transition temperature of magnesium diboride at 39 Kelvin - far above the highest Tc of any of the <link url="http://superconductors.org/Type1.htm">elemental</link> or <link url="http://superconductors.org/type2.htm#alloys">binary alloy</link> superconductors. While 39 K is still well below the Tc's of the "warm" <link url="http://superconductors.org/type2.htm">ceramic superconductors</link>, subsequent refinements in the way MgB<sub>2</sub> is fabricated have paved the way for its use in industrial applications. Laboratory testing has found MgB<sub>2</sub> will <link url="http://superconductors.org/39K_updt.htm">outperform</link> NbTi and Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn wires in high magnetic field applications like <link url="http://superconductors.org/Uses.htm">MRI</link>.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167805176284">     Though a theory to explain high-temperature superconductivity still eludes modern science, clues occasionally appear that contribute to our understanding of the exotic nature of this phenomenon. In 2005, for example, Superconductors.ORG discovered that increasing the weight ratios of alternating planes within the layered perovskites can often <link url="http://superconductors.org/32121212.htm">increase Tc significantly</link>. This has led to the discovery of more than <link url="http://www.superconductors.org/50plus.htm">70 new high-temperature superconductors</link>, including a candidate for a <link url="http://www.superconductors.org/77C.htm">new world record</link>.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167803372138">     The most recent "family" of superconductors to be discovered is the "pnictides". These iron-based superconductors were first observed by a group of Japanese researchers in 2006. Like the high-Tc copper-oxides, the exact mechanism that facilitates superconductivity in them is a mystery. However, with Tc's <link url="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0953-2048/21/8/082001">over 50K</link>, a great deal of excitement has resulted from their discovery.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1167804352825">     Researchers do agree on one thing: discovery in the field of superconductivity is as much serendipity as it is science.</para>
